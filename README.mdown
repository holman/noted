= noted

Just a quick filter in your Rails projects for notes tasked to you. For example:

== install

`gem install noted`

== usage

So, like this:

`def awesome?
  everyone_else?
  # TODO: shit, I should make sure I'm awesome, too       - @holman
end`

...lets you then do something like this:

`noted
=> app/models/awesomator.rb:
=>  * [ 94] [TODO] shit, I should make sure I'm awesome, too       - @holman
`
